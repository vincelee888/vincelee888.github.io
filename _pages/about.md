I earn a living from developing web-based software, and am interested in functional programming, lean/agile delivery, event-driven architectures, clean code, tdd, domain-driven design and continuous improvement. I currently work for Infinity Works, a UK-based software consultancy.

When not looking after my young son, I am trying to get back into running, various forms of cycling and yoga. I have recently found solace in building mechanical keyboards.
