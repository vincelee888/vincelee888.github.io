# Root Cause Analysis

Inevitably, all systems fail. The sign of a good system and teams that support it, is the speed at which the problem is identified and fixed. Once operations have returned to normal, it is good to perform a root cause analysis, to ascertain why it happened. (Nowadays, this is referred to as a blameless post-mortem, but in a good team and organisation, no blame should be the default!)

It is not enough to act upon "the site went down because the newbie deleted the production database!". An3 investigation should take place to find the root cause. A standard method is Five Whys - ask why something happened, and after five iterations you should have found a number of actions that will return higher value than the immediate problem.
