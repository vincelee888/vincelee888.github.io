This post records my career in software so far, and is mostly for catharsis.

# University Industrial Placement Year

After dropping out of studying architecture in my second year of uni, I started a degree in Computing at Manchester Met, which included an industrial placement year. I don't remember applying for many jobs, apart from one job north of Manchester. The first stage of the interview involved a group presentation, and all I can remember is a candidate from Manchester uni (the proper one) being very well coached and trying to bring the rest of the group into the discussion. I felt completely out of my depth, and in awe of this poerson, and happily gave up even hoping to progress. I bumbled through my part of the presentation and drove home kicing mysef.

I eventually got a job for a tiny firm that was affiliated with the university, building e-learning content in Flash. It was quite fun optimising their development process and they were impressed with my skills, but it coincided with the darkest period of my depression. I ended up doing some freelance work later, but was glad to move on.

6/10 - good experience, but self-doubt and poor interviewing skills left me a big fish in a small pond

# First Job After Graduation

Discounting the data entry job I took whilst I looked for a job ("I can type fast, here's something I will be good at! ðŸ¤¦), my first proper job out of university was at a small web agency in the shithole of Leigh. I must have only interviewed at one or two places, and must have been so relieved to have got an offer, I just took it; I even turned down an interview at a proper agency a friend at the time arranged for me! Thus began a string of "medium sized fish, in a shit-strewn pond" jobs in Leigh. 

This first place had countless crappy clients, won over by the sales pitch of a Nigel Farage-wannabe, and much like Brexit, was based on bullshitt, and fucking people over. Many a day was spent dealing with clients who expected the Earth for a couple of grand, trying to photoshop blurry photos of metal widgets, and teaching myself vb6.
