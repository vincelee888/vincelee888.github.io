This post records my career in software so far, and is mostly for catharsis.

# University Industrial Placement Year

After dropping out of studying architecture in my second year of uni, I started a degree in Computing at Manchester Met, which included an industrial placement year. I don't remember applying for many jobs, apart from one job north of Manchester. The first stage of the interview involved a group presentation, and all I can remember is a candidate from Manchester uni (the proper one) being very well coached and trying to bring the rest of the group into the discussion. I felt completely out of my depth, and in awe of this poerson, and happily gave up even hoping to progress. I bumbled through my part of the presentation and drove home kicing mysef.

I eventually got a job for a tiny firm that was affiliated with the university, building e-learning content in Flash. It was quite fun optimising their development process and they were impressed with my skills, but it coincided with the darkest period of my depression. I ended up doing some freelance work later, but was glad to move on.

6/10 - good experience, but self-doubt and poor interviewing skills left me a big fish in a small pond
